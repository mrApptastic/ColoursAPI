# TrueColoursAPI
"I see your true colours shining through... They are beatiful like a rainbow..."

Don't we all just love Cindi Lauper?

One API for every thinkable color. Each and every colour combination has its own name - didn't you know that? Some even have several...

This API enables you to perform various requests regarding RGB, Hex, HSL and CMYK colours.
